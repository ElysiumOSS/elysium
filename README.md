## Architecture & Design

Elysium employs a modern, hybrid architecture combining a high-performance frontend with a lightweight, robust API backend. This design ensures optimal performance, scalability, and maintainability.

### High-Level Architecture

The platform operates on a Serverless-First principle, leveraging Vercel for deployment, which handles both the Astro SSR/SSG content and the ElysiaJS API functions.

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[User Browser] -->|Requests| B[Vercel CDN & Edge]
  B -->|Static Assets and SSR Pages| A
  B -->|API Requests| C[Vercel Serverless Function: ElysiaJS API]
  C -->|Planned data storage| D[Database and External Services]
  C -->|Monitoring| E[Sentry and OpenTelemetry]
  C -->|Analytics| F[PostHog]

  subgraph FE["Frontend (Astro)"]
    B
  end

  subgraph BE["Backend (ElysiaJS)"]
    C
  end

  style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
  style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
  style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
  style D fill:#fcf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
  style E fill:#cff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
  style F fill:#cfc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Explanation of Flow:**

1.  **User Browser:** Initiates requests for web pages or API data.
2.  **Vercel CDN/Edge:** Serves static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images) directly from its global CDN for maximum speed. For dynamic pages or API calls, it routes requests to appropriate serverless functions.
3.  **Vercel Serverless Function (ElysiaJS API):** For API requests, Vercel invokes a serverless function running the ElysiaJS application. This function handles business logic, interacts with data stores, and returns responses.
4.  **Database / External Services:** The ElysiaJS API interacts with various backend services or databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, third-party APIs) to retrieve or persist data. *(Currently, direct database interaction is planned but not fully implemented in the provided code structure, focusing more on the API infrastructure).*
5.  **Sentry / OpenTelemetry:** Both frontend and backend send error reports (Sentry) and distributed traces (OpenTelemetry) to monitoring services for robust observability.
6.  **PostHog:** Frontend captures user analytics events for product insights.

### Core Modules

The application's codebase is structured into logical modules to enhance maintainability and collaboration:

*   **`src/api/routes`**: This directory houses all the ElysiaJS API endpoints. Each subdirectory (e.g., `auth`, `health`, `info`, `media`, `protected`, `utility`, `version`) represents a distinct API domain, promoting modularity and clear separation of concerns.
*   **`src/components`**: Contains reusable Astro components (e.g., `hero.astro`, `navbar.astro`, `footer.astro`) that form the building blocks of the frontend UI.
*   **`src/core`**: Holds core application logic, including:
    *   `config/`: Application constants and configurations.
    *   `errors/`: Centralized error handling and custom error types.
    *   `helpers/`: General utility functions.
    *   `middleware-handlers/`: Custom middleware for both Astro and ElysiaJS (where applicable).
    *   `types/`: Shared TypeScript type definitions.
*   **`src/pages`**: Astro pages that define the routes and content for the public-facing website (e.g., `index.astro`, `about.astro`, `support.astro`).
*   **`public/`**: Static assets like favicons, `robots.txt`, `manifest.json`, and service workers.
*   **`lib/`**: External library integrations or helper functions like `open-graph-scraper`.

### Technology Stack

Elysium is built upon a modern and high-performance technology stack:

*   **Frontend Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/) (v5.x) for fast content-focused websites, SSR, and SSG.
*   **Backend Framework**: [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) (v1.4.x) for high-performance, type-safe APIs, often run with Bun.

## Limitations, Known Issues & Future Roadmap

Elysium is under active development. This section outlines current considerations and plans for future enhancements.

### Current Limitations

*   **Database Integration:** While the architecture allows for various data storage solutions, direct database integration (e.g., ORM setup, connection pooling) is not fully represented in the provided core modules and may require additional setup based on your chosen database.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Initial versions may have limited unit/integration test coverage, which will be expanded over time.
*   **Authentication Provider Agnostic:** Currently, authentication is based on bearer tokens. Integration with specific OAuth providers or more complex identity management systems would require further development.
*   **Admin Interface:** There is no built-in administrative interface for managing content or users; such features would need to be built on top of the existing API.

### Known Issues

*   **Sentry DSN Warning:** If `PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is not configured, Sentry will log a warning to the console during startup, as indicated in `sentry.client.config.js` and `sentry.server.config.js`. This is expected behavior and serves as a reminder to configure Sentry.
*   **Initial Build Times:** Depending on your environment and dependencies, the initial `npm run build` might take a moment due to comprehensive optimizations.

### Future Roadmap

We have exciting plans for the evolution of Elysium:

*   **Full Database Integration:** Implement support for popular databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) with ORM/ODM solutions, including migration tools.
*   **Enhanced API Features:** Expand API routes with advanced functionalities such as file uploads, real-time communication (WebSockets), and more complex query capabilities.
*   **Authentication & Authorization Module:** Develop a more abstract and configurable authentication module, supporting various strategies (e.g., OAuth, SSO).
*   **CLI Tooling:** Introduce custom CLI commands for scaffolding new API routes, components, or deploying the application.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Add full support for multiple languages on the frontend.
*   **Theming & Customization:** Provide more extensive theming options and component customization utilities.
*   **Automated Testing:** Increase unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage for all core modules and API endpoints.
*   **Performance Benchmarking:** Regular performance testing and optimization cycles for both frontend and backend.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>
<summary>Q: Why did you choose Astro for the frontend?</summary>
A: Astro was chosen for its exceptional performance characteristics, particularly its ability to deliver nearly pure HTML and JavaScript only where necessary ("Astro Islands"). This results in very fast loading times, excellent SEO, and a great developer experience for content-heavy sites and web applications.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Why ElysiaJS for the backend API?</summary>
A: ElysiaJS stands out for its high performance, type safety (thanks to TypeScript and Effect Schema), and Bun-first approach. It offers a minimalistic yet powerful framework that allows for building robust APIs with minimal overhead, making it ideal for scalable serverless functions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Can I use Node.js instead of Bun for the ElysiaJS API?</summary>
A: Yes, ElysiaJS is compatible with Node.js. While Bun is recommended for its performance benefits and integrated tooling, you can run the ElysiaJS backend with Node.js. However, the `package.json` scripts currently use `astro dev` which internally might use Node, but explicit Bun usage for ElysiaJS parts often yields better results.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: How do I add a new API endpoint?</summary>
A: Navigate to `src/api/routes`. Create a new directory for your endpoint (e.g., `src/api/routes/my-feature/`) and add an `index.ts` file. Define your ElysiaJS routes within this file, ensuring proper export for integration.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: How do I add a new frontend page?</summary>
A: Create a new `.astro` file inside `src/pages/` (e.g., `src/pages/my-new-page.astro`). Astro will automatically create a route for it (e.g., `/my-new-page`). For nested routes, create subdirectories.
</details>

### Troubleshooting

*   **`Sentry DSN is missing` warning:** This means the `PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` environment variable is not set. Please refer to the [Configuration](#configuration) section to set it up. Sentry will not track errors without a DSN.
*   **`Error: Cannot find module 'sharp'` during build:** This usually indicates a problem with `sharp`'s native dependencies. Ensure your environment has the necessary build tools, or try reinstalling `sharp`: `npm rebuild sharp`.
*   **API routes not working locally:**
    *   Ensure the development server is running (`npm run dev`).
    *   Check your `PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` and other `.env` variables for syntax errors.
    *   Verify the API route paths match those defined in `src/api/routes`.
    *   Consult the browser's developer console and server logs for error messages.
*   **Animations not working:**
    *   Check the browser's console for JavaScript errors.
    *   Ensure GSAP and Lenis scripts are correctly loaded and initialized in your Astro components (e.g., `smooth-scroll.astro`).
